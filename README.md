Created a webpage application for Adopting a DOG.
The Script.js file has functions to fetch data from an External API, create HTML elements dynamically, and display information about dogs in a web page.
The Adoptdog.js file is managing a dynamic list of dogs for adoption on a web page, allowing users to adopt dogs by clicking on the "Adopt" button associated with each dog listing.
The Main.js file dynamically populates a dropdown menu with dog breeds fetched from an External API, displays information about the selected breed, and initiates the adoption process when a breed is selected from the adoption list.
Added Post and Put method to add a new data and update the data and is imported to a new.js file.
Used both async and await functions accordingly.
Organized  JavaScript code into different module files, and imported functions and data across files as necessary.
The program runs successfully without any error.
